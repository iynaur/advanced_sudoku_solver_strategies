This paper aims to develop and implement a set of 5 advanced techniques that encompass and summarize all known techniques, from the simplest to the most complex.
 
Some of these 5 techniques are not intended to be a model of application by a person since, due to their complexity, they may only be available to computer processing. 
 
These 5 techniques exclude brute force, trial and error, and backtracking techniques and, in general, any technique that is based on divination. Only techniques that allow solving a sudoku logic are used.  
 
The design is designed to prioritize effectiveness over efficiency. 
 
The implementation is designed with readability over efficiency. 
 
The model can be improved to obtain more efficient results in terms of execution times, but it is not the objective of this paper to be efficient in execution time. 
 Sets have been used with their solutions, through the tool ​qqwing​ at the expert and intermediate levels. For intermediates, the efficiency is 100%. In the case of experts, the effectiveness is approximately 75% due to the fact that, in their set of tests, they are considered cases in which the application of brute force or divination techniques in general is necessary. 
 
This paper addresses both the different techniques and the strategy to be applied. 
 
The implementation has been carried out in Python using the Numpty, PyGame and Intertools libraries.
